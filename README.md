🤖 6-DOF Hand Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm

Developed a 6-DOF robotic arm controlled through real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and Arduino. The system translates specific hand gestures into robotic movements, enabling:

XYZ positioning of the arm

Pick-and-place operations

Gripper control (open/close via gestures)

Smooth joint coordination using inverse kinematics

Automated pick-and-place with integrated object detection

This project combines computer vision, embedded systems, and robotics, showcasing human-robot interaction through intuitive gesture-based control.
